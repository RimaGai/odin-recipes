  <h2>Chicken, Potatoes, and Leeks with Pine Nut Gremolata</h2>
  <p>For the crispiest skin and most flavorful meat, roast bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs and legs over a bed of leeks
    and potatoes, where they render fat and absorb flavor. A quick turn under the broiler imparts a golden finish to the
    chicken before they're basted in pan juices and dressed with a zippy gremolata made from toasted pine nuts, garlic,
    and parsley. Cookbook author Leah Koenig loves to serve these during the Passover holiday, but they're a special
    dinner any night of the year.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <h4>Gremolata</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1 small bunch fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves and tender stems, tough stem ends removed</li>
    <li>⅓ cup pine nuts, toasted</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon grated lemon zest (from 1 large lemon)</li>
    <li>1 large garlic clove, finely chopped (about 1 teaspoon)</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Chicken</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1 ½ pounds Yukon Gold potatoes (about 4 medium potatoes), peeled, quartered lengthwise, and cut into
      1/2-inch-thick wedges</li>
    <li>3 medium leeks, cut crosswise into 3/4-inch-thick pieces (about 4 cups)</li>
    <li>1 garlic head, cloves separated and peeled (10 to 12 cloves)
    </li>
    <li>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided
    </li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt, divided

    </li>
    <li>½ teaspoon black pepper, divided</li>
    <li>½ cup chicken broth</li>
    <li>4 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs and legs (about 12 pieces), trimmed</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <h4>Make the gremolata</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Combine parsley, pine nuts, lemon zest, and garlic on a cutting board. Sprinkle with salt, and finely chop
      mixture together. Transfer gremolata to a bowl, and set aside.</li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Make the chicken</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Preheat oven to 400°F with rack 8 inches from heat. Arrange potatoes, leeks, and garlic cloves in bottom of a
      large broiler-safe roasting pan. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons oil; sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon
      pepper. Toss to coat. Pour broth into roasting pan.
    </li>
    <li>Arrange chicken pieces, skin side up, on top of vegetable mixture in roasting pan. Brush chicken evenly with
      remaining 2 tablespoons oil; sprinkle evenly with remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper.
    </li>
    <li>Roast in preheated oven on rack 8 inches from heat until vegetables are tender and a thermometer inserted in
      thickest portion of chicken registers 165°F, 40 to 45 minutes, spooning pan juices over chicken after about 20
      minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Increase oven temperature to broil. (Do not remove roasting pan from oven.) Broil until chicken skin is golden
      brown, about 5 minutes. Remove from oven, and let cool 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Transfer chicken pieces and vegetables to a platter. Spoon sauce from roasting pan over chicken; scatter
      generously with gremolata (about 3/4 cup). Serve hot alongside any remaining gremolata for sprinkling.</li>
  </ol>
