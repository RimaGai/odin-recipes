</ul>
<h4>Sunflower seed pesto</h4>
<ul>
  <li>½ cup basil leaves</li>
  <li>¼ cup toasted sunflower seeds</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice, fresh is best</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon fresh dill</li>
  <li>1 green onion, green part only</li>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat your oven to 450 degrees. Place the broccoli on a baking sheet and toss with olive oil and salt. Put the
    baking
    sheet into the oven for 20 minutes, or until the broccoli is soft and the florets are starting to get crispy.

  <li>While the broccoli roasts, prepare the rest of the meal. Place all of the sunflower seed pesto ingredients into
    your
    blender or food processor and blend on high until mostly smooth. If needed, thin with a little water, starting with
    1
    tablespoon.
    ¼ cup toasted sunflower seeds,½ cup basil leaves,2 tablespoons lemon juice,1 tablespoon fresh dill,2 tablespoons
    olive
    oil,1 clove garlic,1 tablespoon mayonnaise,1 green onion</li>
  <li>Dry the salmon well then season it with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a large, ovenproof pan over medium-high
    heat.
    Once hot, add the salmon skin side down. Let the salmon cook undisturbed for 3-4 minutes, or until the skin is nice
    and
    crispy. Shake the pan a few times to help the salmon release from the pan. Once the skin is crispy, put the pan into
    the
    oven and cook the salmon for 4 minutes more.

    sprigs, if you'd like.
