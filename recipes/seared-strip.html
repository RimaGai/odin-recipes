  <h2>Seared Strip Steak with Crispy Potatoes & Mustard Sauce</h2>
  <p>Sharing a dinner today that I have been making over and over again: seared strip steak with crispy potatoes &
    mustard
    sauce. It is a new york strip steak seared simply with kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper, served
    alongside
    a
    mixture of roasted potatoes, asparagus, and radishes, and drizzled with a tangy mustard caper sauce. Great for both
    weeknight cooking or a special weekend meal.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <h4>Mustard sauce</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>2 tbsp dijon mustard</li>
    <li>1 tbsp honey</li>
    <li>1 tbsp caper liquid (from the jar of capers)</li>
    <li>2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>2 tbsp capers</li>
    <li>⅛ tsp cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>2 scallions, thinly sliced</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Seared Strip Steak with Crispy Potatoes</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>¾ lb fingerling potatoes, halved lengthwise</li>
    <li>6 small radishes</li>
    <li>olive oil</li>
    <li>kosher salt</li>
    <li>freshly cracked black pepper</li>
    <li>½ bunch asparagus, trimmed + peeled + thinly sliced (about 6 oz total)</li>
    <li>1 shallot, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>1 (16 oz) NY strip steak</li>
    <li>1 tbsp minced chives</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <h4>Mustard Sauce</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Combine the mustard, honey, and caper liquid in a small mixing bowl. Whisk until smooth. Drizzle in the olive
      oil,
      whisking until emulsified.</li>
    <li>Stir in the capers, cayenne pepper, and scallions. Season with a pinch of salt to taste and set aside.</li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Seared Strip Steak with Crispy Potatoes</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F. Allow the steak to come to room temperature.
    </li>
    <li>Place the potatoes and radishes onto a half sheet pan. Drizzle generously with olive oil and toss to coat.
      Spread the
      vegetables out into an even layer, potatoes halved-side down. Season with a good pinch of salt and black pepper.
      Roast
      for 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Evenly distribute the sliced asparagus and shallot onto the pan. Drizzle with a little more olive oil. Continue
      to roast
      for about 15-20 more minutes, or until the potatoes are golden and tender.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, pat the steak dry and season well with salt & freshly cracked black pepper. Heat a stainless steel
      pan (or
      cast-iron skillet) over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, add enough oil to just cover the bottom. Once the
      oil is
      hot, carefully place the steak into the pan.</li>
    <li>Sear on one side for 3-4 minutes until golden and crisp. Flip the steak over and sear for another 3-4 minutes.
      Turn the
      heat to low and finish cooking the steak for about 6-8 more minutes, or until your desired doneness, flipping
      halfway
      through. Transfer the steak to a cutting board and cover loosely with foil. Let rest for 5 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Thinly slice the steak and serve alongside the roasted potato mixture. Drizzle the mustard sauce over top.
      Garnish with
      the chives and a few cracks of black pepper.</li>
  </ol>
